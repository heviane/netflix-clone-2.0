/* ----- Code refactored according to javascript language good practices
    Prompt used:
        Rewrite the JAVASCRIPT code below in a more efficient way 
        and applying good practices and then explain to me the rules applied:
        ...paste code here...

    Return and Explanations:
        - camelCase Variable Names: Changed variable names to camelCase (e.g., api_key to apiKey). 
        This follows the common JavaScript naming convention, making the code more readable.
        - snake_case Constants Names: Kept constants (variables not reassigned) in snake_case, 
        following the common practice to indicate they are constant values.
        - Descriptive Names: Chose more descriptive names for variables 
        so that the purpose of each one is clearer.
        - Semicolons: Added semicolons at the end of each statement. 
        Although JavaScript allows omitting semicolons in some cases, 
        including them is a good practice to avoid automatic semicolon insertion issues.
        
        These practices make the code cleaner, more readable, and consistent, 
        facilitating maintenance and understanding by other developers.
